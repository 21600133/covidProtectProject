## What does this project do?

It provides people with preventable measures against the coronavirus situation, reminding them of the basic rules to follow in various situations.

## Why is this project useful?

-Soon as summer approaches, people's outdoor activities become more frequent, and by reminding people of the dull awareness, there is an advantage of the influence to reduce the spread of infection to some extent.

## How do I get started?

The COVID19 situation, which had been quiet until a few months ago, has suddenly spread and taken people's daily lives away. We came to create a project to make people aware that we should try to get back to our old routine first.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

-I would like to establish a system that informs the current COVID19 situation in real time and make a system that notifies confirmed people every specific time compared to the previous day.
